                    <span class="rolling-section2">The torsion springs on steel rolling doors work the same way as other torsion  springs in the garage door industry. When the door is closed, the spring is  wound. The spring is secured to a spring anchor bracket on one end and to the  shaft on the other. When the steel rolling door opens, the spring in the barrel  supports most of the door weight. The remainder of this weight is lifted by the  chain hoist or the operator.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="pt-4 home-div">
                    <span class="rolling-section2">As the steel rolling door opens, the slats wrap around the barrel. Meanwhile,  the torsion spring unwinds. When the door is fully open, there is still a small  amount of tension in the spring to keep the door from unrolling.</span>

    </div>
    <div class="ps-4 pt-2 rolling-section3">
        While the door opens, the moment arm (the distance between the center of the  shaft and the point on the door that is starting to be wrapped around the  barrel) increases. This means that the apparent weight of the door does not  decrease as rapidly when it opens. As a result, steel rolling doors typically do  not balance well in the middle of their travel. This has to be sacrificed to  allow the door to stay down when it is closed and stay up when it is open.
    </div>
    <div class="ps-4 pt-4 rolling-section3">
        When torsion springs are wound, they grow in length. Since both ends of the torsion springs on steel rolling doors are secured and cannot move, the spring cannot grow in length. There are two options for fixing this problem. You can stretch the spring yourself with a come-a-long before you secure it to the shaft, or your can purchase pre-stretched springs. This allows the coils to be gapped and to lose most of this gapping when the door closes.

                    <strong class="rolling-seciton6">How to Measure Your Torsion Spring There are five characteristics of your broken torsion spring that you will need to determine in order to purchase a new spring. You need to measure the length and wire size of the spring, determine the inside diameter and wind, and identify the type of ends on the spring.</strong>

    </div>
    <div class="pt-2 pt-4">
        <span class="rolling-section3">To determine the wire size, you will need to measure the length of 10  coils and of 20 coils. If your spring is gapped in order to keep the coils from  binding, you will need to compress the coils to make this measurement. You also  need to compress the spring to measure its length, which is the distance  from the last coil on one end of the spring to the last coil on the other end.  You must compress the torsion spring and not include the gap between the broken  pieces of the spring to properly measure your spring.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-2 pt-4">
        <span class="rolling-section3">There is usually a marking on the cones of the spring to identify the inside diameter. If this identification cannot be found, you can measure the space inside the coils. Your spring will either be left or right wind. See our Torsion Spring FAQ's to determine the wind of your spring.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-2 pt-4">
        <span class="rolling-section3">Lastly, you will need to identify how the torsion spring is shaped at the ends. There are primarily two types of spring ends for torsion springs on steel rolling doors. The ends of some springs wrap into the spring cones. If this is the case, you will need to order special straight ends and heat the wire to wrap it into the cones. Other steel rolling doors use torsion springs with a loop at each end. If you have this type of a spring, you will need to order it with steel rolling door loops.</span>

    <div class="pt-2 pt-4">
        <span class="rolling-section3">Replace One Spring or All of the Springs? If your steel rolling door has multiple springs, we strongly advise you to replace all of the springs at once. If one spring breaks, there is a good chance that the other springs will break within the next couple of months. Replacing all of your springs at once takes much less time than individually replacing the springs. This will also reducing shipping costs. For more information, visit our Torsion Spring FAQ's page.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-2 pt-4">
        <span class="rolling-section3">Note: If you have multiple springs, you will need to measure each one of them. The springs do not always have the same dimensions, so you will need to determine this for each spring.</span>
